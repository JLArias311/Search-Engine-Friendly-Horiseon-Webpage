# Search-Engine-Friendly-Horiseon-Webpage
Refractored version of Horiseon's Webpage

# Updates Made

I organized the heading to fall in sequential order by making sure the order showed the meta charset, the title, and then the CSS links.

I added the a reset CSS link, that I coded before my CSS style sheet.

I then replaced all div elements with appropriate semantic HTML elements.

I had to alter the CSS style sheet to accomodate to all the tag changes.

I made sure the different layers of the tags indented as the section gained layers.

I added alt ids to all image elements

I titled the page with "Horiseon Home Page"
